                    Roche is a pharmaceutical company based out of Basel Switzerland. They have offices in 
                    many countries across the globe, including their Mississauga office, which is where I 
                    worked for my co-op. Roche is the fourth largest pharmaceutical country in the world, 
                    and the leading provider of cancer treatments globally

                    I had several goals when entering my first co-op work term:

                    <li>
                        My first goal was to improve on my inquiry and analysis skills. My strategy to achieve 
                        this goal was to actively engage and participate in clarification meetings for projects 
                        throughout my coop term. Doing so helped me to become better at inquiring for information 
                        that is needed to successfully complete a project. It also helped me to improve my skills 
                        related to analysis as I had to analyze the information given to me during clarification meetings.

                    <li>
                        My second goal was to improve my problem-solving skills, which would be helpful for all my future 
                        career goals. My strategy to achieve this goal was to work on a variety of projects throughout my 
                        coop term, and in doing so, improve on my problem-solving skills. These skills naturally developed 
                        while working on projects during my coop term. This is because the projects that I worked on came 
                        with a variety of problems and challenges that I had to face while completing them, which in turn 
                        helped to improve my problem-solving skills.

                    <li>
                        My third and final goal was to improve my teamwork skills, as working in a team will be a part of 
                        almost any job that I may have in the future. My strategy to achieve this goal was to actively work 
                        with other coop students while working on projects during my coop term. Doing so helped me to improve 
                        my teamwork skills, and it also helped me to achieve my other learning goals as well. This is because 
                        working in a team also helped me to develop problem solving skills as well as inquiry and analysis 
                        skills.

                    While at Roche, I worked as a Pharma Technical Analyst within their intern program, FutureWorks. The way 
                    FutureWorks operates is that anybody that works at Roche can submit projects to FutureWorks. A FutureWorks 
                    intern will then hold a clarification meeting with the project sponsor to learn more about the project, and 
                    then whichever intern(s) is interested in the project can choose to work on it. An example of a project that 
                    I worked on while at Roche was a sustainable materials database. At Roche, to manufacture the pharmaceutical 
                    medications, they use a bunch of different chemicals. And in an effort be more environmentally friendly, as 
                    well as cautious about the effects these chemicals have on people's health, Roche utilises a bunch of different 
                    spreadsheets and tables from different global organisations to make decisions on what chemicals they use. This 
                    however is very time consuming due to the number of sheets they have to analyse to make a decision. The goal 
                    of the project was to reduce the amount of time they needed to spend analysing these sheets by putting it all 
                    into one, easy to access database. My role while working on this project was to use python to pull the 
                    information from all of the different tables and sheets, and then put all of the data into a google cloud 
                    BigQuery database which was then able to be accessed by an app that the project sponser had built.
